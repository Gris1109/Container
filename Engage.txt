DESCRIPTION 
Welcome to the partnership NetDevOps Track designed by Cisco and ucode IT academy! 
As we see, today, programs have become much bigger than ever before. 
And it is not always very convenient to pass complicated systems between devices. 
Have you ever thought about why nearly all ucode materials contain information about 
software versions you need to use? 

For example, you can write print "box:", box in Python2, but it won`t work in Python3. 
Yes, it is an oversimpliﬁed example, but it shows that you always need to take care of 
the working environment. Because it won't be so easy with 10 dependencies, and error 
messages will deﬁnitely infuriate you. 

Until 2013, there was no standard solution, which would help to transfer systems with 
their dependencies across devices. But then Docker appeared with the idea that we can 
put everything we want into containers, and transfer them as easily as we transfer goods 
on ships or planes. Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual 
container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. 

This challenge includes tasks for understanding how to deal with this cool technology. 
Figure out why no modern DevOps engineer could live without it.

BIG IDEA 
Containerization.

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS 
How to put your program into a container?

CHALLENGE 
Create your ﬁrst containers and learn how to work with them.
